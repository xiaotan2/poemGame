I love
I love
I love you so
If I had a
I'd give you the shell

Please be my
I will open for you the
I will let you pick my
I will hold your hand
I will let you touch my

May this bow of
Which gives
And which I send
A token be of love
Oh, will't thou be

Mother's eyes began to
And then she made this
If you love me as I love
No knife shall cut our love in
And father laughed and said

The first one says, My love is
The second one says, You have my
The third one says, We'll never
The fourth one says, Won't you please be
The fifth one says, Til the end of

Won't you be my
And fly away with
We'll bumble along
Cause you're my Honey
Fiddle dee dee, fiddle dee

You're Hershey's, you're
You're sweet English
If you spit in my
You'll just sweeten my
That I'm getting

I love
I'll kiss you and hug
Cause you love me
So smile 'cause I love
On this Valentine's

When the moon begins to eclipse we'll be in each others
I never knew how much of a sweet tart you could
There are zero people like
You're my lifesaver in this unforgiving
I love your little

I want to share all of your
Now and later, always and
You're all the payday I'll ever
I wouldn't trade you for 100
All because I love my sweet

Valentines Day is coming up, and I don't have a valentine, so now what shall I
Almost every boy has asked me, everyone but
Who is this person you
Oh only the boy I've been crushing on since the second
He's walking my way, has my day come at
